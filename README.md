# dotfiles

Dotfiles for my dev setup, using Windows 10. Also check [my brother's AHK repo](https://github.com/mtsknn/autohotkey), while they're not exactly dotfiles I'm using a lot of scripts from him.

## Software

- [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- [AutoHotkey (v2)](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
